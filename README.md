# CtoC

#### Environment:
- python 3.7.3
- Windows (probably works for macOS as well)


#### How-to:
1. Always run client 1 before you start client 2


#### Description:
Chat between client 1 and client 2 without an additional server.
Every version provides a new functionality along following items:
- all within defined functions / classes (modular structure)
- just one socket in use
- "dynamic" chatting
- prevent application from crashing due an expected 'ConnectionResetError' (connection handling) in both directions

Version 6 is my final prototype atm.
